This project was looking at the amount of gun violence taking place in Kansas City, Missouri. The crimerates in this area have steadily increased over the year, and it never fails to be mentioned on the news that there was some new shooting in the area. I wanted to look at the crime data, and then compare the amount of gun violence to the other crime rates in the city to see if it was as bad as media makes it sound.
